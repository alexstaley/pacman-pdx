# Installed custom logos.

1. Attempted to use a photo for the name "Pacman" but that was not successful.
2. Went to https://icomoon.io/app/#/select and created a font-type and loaded into css files.
3. Created index.css for the login page. Each letter for "Pacman" takes 4 css styles that are framed
   inside of a span. Kind of like stacking each style on-top of each other.

# Installed Firebase

1. Created firebase.js with all firebase configurations from firebase
2. created a login.js for the function call when login is pressed from index.html.
3. attempted to do defer src = login.js, and assign onClick inside of index.html assign "SignIn".
4. Received SignIn() error, not defined. It also changed the look of the page for some reason.
5. Installed firebase to root folder.
